# ESP01-Riders
Use an ESP-01,  L9110s, servo, two outlet phone charger, some meccano and a motor to get you ESP-Riding

ESP-01 and its flasher are used to steer and move a small toy car.

ESP-01 Proof it works.  :)   Common ground is in the power pack.  Tapped the power and ground going to the esp-01 for the servo to avoid
even more spaghetti with a logic level converter.  

Built the software in two parts. motors then servos and merged the software and dumped all the serial prints.
